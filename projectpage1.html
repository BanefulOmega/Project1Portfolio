        <p>
            Hey my name is Christopher Bivona. I am 20 years old. I'm a computer science major from the College of Staten Island(CSI). My hobbies are listening to music, playing video games, working out, watching anime, learning different languages and learning different coding languages. My personality is very random, which means I'm hard to predict but in a good way. I'm a very professional and sociable person when it comes to my work.

            Why coding you might ask. I chose coding because I was also to learn the software of the computer and how it works especially with websites or programs. I was always tech savvy when I was younger. So I thought I might as well learn and get to know the software. Since I already learned the hardware of the computer.
